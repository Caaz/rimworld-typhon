  +UpdateNews("1.0.0.2")
    | Enhanced Mimic mimicing (If updated mid-game these changes will take effect next time they hide)
    | - Hidden mimics are no longer clickable
    | - Hidden Mimics no longer show tooltip on hover
    | Better build process
    | - Cleaned up steam uploads a ton, now without source code! If you want that, go to github!
    | Thanks for all the suggestions and support!

  +UpdateNews("1.0.0.1")
    | Rebalanced Mimics
    | - Reduced mimic damage, increased cooldown on attacks
    | - Reduced surprise attack damage
    | 
    | Added target size restrition to Mimics
    | - Ensures they only attack things of size &lt; 1.5
    | 
    | Introduced UpdateFeatureDef
    | - So I can show these notes!
    | - pugjs fought me. I learned a new dynamic thing and will probably wind up re-writing a ton of defs
