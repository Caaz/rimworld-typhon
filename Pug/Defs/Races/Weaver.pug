+ThingDef("Typhon_Weaver_Race", "weaver")(ParentName="TyphonThingBase")
  description What's known about this Typhon is how it's been seen to create these strand like essence, Coral; weaving it into beautiful looking fields of yellow almost transparent strings, hence the name. Cystoids have been noted to be around this Typhon while it's also seen to emit a shield-like field around itself that projects unnerving thoughts into a weak-minded individuals head, causing them to tremble or flee from fear. One last observation spotted is their ability to create Typhon with a humanoid figure from bodies of dead or unconcious people and the ability to create other forms of Typhon from the Mimics.  Word of advice: make sure you stop them from doing so and exercise caution.
