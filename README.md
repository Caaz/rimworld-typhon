## Description

This is a Rimworld Mod that adds the [Typhon aliens from the game Prey](https://prey.fandom.com/wiki/Typhon). Being psychic creatures feels like a perfect addtion to the lore of Rimworld. 

## Development
### Dependencies

#### C#
Nuget handles all of the current C# dependencies. Visual Studio seems to handle that fine.

#### XML
XML building is part of the build post script, in order to compile pugjs you'll need [pug-cli](https://github.com/pugjs/pug-cli) installed.

## Testing

The [latest build action on the main branch](https://github.com/Caaz/rimworld-typhon/actions/workflows/Build.yml?query=branch%3Amain) will hold the last (hopefully) stable build of this mod. If you run into any issues, feel free to create a new issue.
