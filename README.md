# Typhon

*A Rimworld Mod*

## Description

This is a Rimworld Mod that adds the [Typhon aliens from the game Prey](https://prey.fandom.com/wiki/Typhon). Being psychic creatures feels like a perfect addtion to the lore of Rimworld. 

## Planning

The following is the current planned phases and feature sets within them. This isn't set in stone, but it should give a bit of direction, if you'd like to help contribute!

### Phase 1 - Mimic

- [ ] Add the [Mimic Typhon](https://prey.fandom.com/wiki/Mimic).
- [x] Mimics should feed on corpses, multiplying into more mimics!
- [x] Mimics should copy the visual look of objects, when not in combat. They wait there til they can ambush!
- [ ] Mimic bodies should be processable somehow into psychic-related items
    - [ ] Through the medicine bench? Or should it be through butchering?
- [ ] Add an event, introducing mimics to an area, using something like a crashed drop pod, that could introduce a single mimic.
    - [ ] Maybe with a downed pawn to go with it?
- [ ] Add psychic abilities from Prey
    - [ ] Requires research. Time to actually play Prey myself.
    - This may require this mod to be Royalty dependant!
- [ ] Mimics should have custom sounds!

### Phase 2 - Weaver


- [ ] Add the [Weaver Typhon](https://prey.fandom.com/wiki/Weaver).
- [ ] Add a new job to Mimics, to count nearby mimics, and if 6 or more exist, they should fight another mimic, and force it to turn into a Weaver!
- [ ] Add [Coral](https://prey.fandom.com/wiki/Coral)
    - [ ] Seems like this should inflict a fear response in anything that damages it.
    - [ ] Probably should go away with time.
- [ ] Add [https://prey.fandom.com/wiki/Phantom]
